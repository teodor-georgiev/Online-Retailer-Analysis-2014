# Online-retailer-analysis
## Introduction
In this repository, you will find an example of online retailer analysis using python, with the goal of predicting if an ordered item is going to be returned or not. The dataset and the task of predicting the return of an item stem from the Data Mining Cup 2014. The dataset encompasses 13 months of sales data for a German online clothing retailer and contains over 530 000 items ordered. The dataset contains features describing the items, as well as the customer who placed the order.

Predicting if a customer is going to return an item is an important task for online retailers, as returned items incur costs for the retailer. For this reason it could be beneficial if the retailer could predict if a customer is going to return an item before the item is shipped. This would allow the retailer to take action to prevent the return, such as limiting the number of items a customer can order, reminding the customer of the environmental impact of returning items, limiting his payment options, or even prohibiting the customer from ordering altogether.
